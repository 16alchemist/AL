Hi Comp experts!

I am new to programming and after reading through some articles about how computers are programmed to work, i decided to learn more about programming. My interest is in Linux OS, python and Javascript languages so here I am at Github. With your help, i will be able to write simple programms myself as well as to be able to edit some of the programms.
